            Worried about the worries <br />
            till it got worrisome <br />
            and I was tired and weary. <br />
            That's the routine <br />
            in the shower <br />
            as we start the day <br />
            overthinking. <br />
            And just how thsy'll want you<br />
            because they need you <br />
            but never be there in the end...<br />
            or when someone's at the other <br />
            side <br />
            you complain about the crowd <br />
            and how you just want to be left alone. <br />
            <br />
            Years rolled by still haven't <br />
            gotten used to it. <br />
            instead it sinks harder than<br />
            the last time it hits. <br />
            And at the end you come out odd<br />
            and strange <br />
            because those personalities <br />
            might seem always calmâ€”<br />
            but could sometimes be<br />
            deranged.<br />
